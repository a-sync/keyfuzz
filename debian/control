Description: Manipulate the scancode/keycode translation tables of keyboard drivers
 You may use keyfuzz to manipulate the scancode/keycode translation
 tables of keyboard drivers supporting the Linux input layer API (as
 included in Linux 2.6). This is useful for fixing the translation
 tables of multimedia keyboards or laptop keyboards with special
 keys. keyfuzz is not a daemon like Gnome acme which reacts on special
 hotkeys but a tool to make non-standard keyboards compatible with
 such daemons. keyfuzz should be run once at boot time, the
 modifications it makes stay active after the tool quits until
 reboot. keyfuzz does not interact directly with XFree86. However,
 newer releases of the latter (4.1 and above) rely on the Linux input
 API, so they take advantage of the fixed translation tables.
