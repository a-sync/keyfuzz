News

   Tue Jan 14 2006:

   [10]Version 0.2 released, include one more keyfuzz definition file.

   Sun Jan 25 2004:

   [11]Version 0.1 released, initial release.

Overview

   You may use keyfuzz to manipulate the scancode/keycode translation
   tables of keyboard drivers supporting the Linux input layer API (as
   included in Linux 2.6). This is useful for fixing the translation
   tables of multimedia keyboards or laptop keyboards with special keys.
   keyfuzz is not a daemon like Gnome acme which reacts on special
   hotkeys but a tool to make non-standard keyboards compatible with such
   daemons. keyfuzz should be run once at boot time, the modifications it
   makes stay active after the tool quits until reboot. keyfuzz does not
   interact directly with XFree86. However, newer releases of the latter
   (4.1 and above) rely on the Linux input API, so they take advantage of
   the fixed translation tables.

   The distribution includes scancode tables for [12]Medion 9580F and
   [13]MSI S270 laptops. Feel free to send me scancodes table, I will
   integrate them into my package!

Current Status

   Version 0.2 is more or less stable and feature complete.

Documentation

   Have a look on the man page [14]keyfuzz(8). (An XSLT capable browser
   is required)

   Scancode tables assign scancodes to keycodes. If you don't now what
   scancodes or keycodes are, read about it in the relevant HOWTOs or
   FAQs available from the [15]Linux Documentation Project.

   The primary target of keyfuzz is to patch scancode/keycode definitions
   for special multimedia keys into the current scancode table of a
   device. An example for such a patch table is the following file
   medion_9580f.keyfuzz, which is relevant for the Medion 9580F laptop
   which has four special multimedia keys:
# Mail
0x67    155

# World Wide Web
0x63    150

# Program #1
0x66    148

# Program #2
0x69    149

   Activate this file with the following command:
keyfuzz -s < medion_9580f.keyfuzz

   This assigns the scancode 0x67 to the keycode 155 and so on. For a
   list of available keycodes have look on the KEY_xxx constant
   definitions in /usr/include/linux/input.h. The scancodes are keyboard
   specific. You may use the (console specific) utility showkey(1) to
   examine the scancode/keycode of a key. Another way to get the
   scancodes of special keys is to look for kernel debug messages like
   these if you press the relevant keys:
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x66 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x66 on isa0060/serio0).

   Feel free to to send me patch tables for your hardware. I'll add them
   to my to distribution.

   The keyfuzz distribution includes a SysV init script which runs
   keyfuzz -s for all configured input devices depending on files or
   symbolics links named after the devices in /etc/keyfuzz. If you want
   to use this script, just create a symlink /etc/keyfuzz/event0 to a
   scancode table file (e.g. /etc/keyfuzz/medion_9580f.keyfuzz). The
   scancode table of the device /dev/input/event0 is modified according
   to the contents of that file on each boot:
cd /etc/keyfuzz
ln -s medion_9580f.keyfuzz event0

   The virtual file /proc/bus/input/devices lists all available input
   devices.

Requirements

   keyfuzz requires a kernel supporting the Linux input layer, such as
   2.6.1.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of keyfuzz.

Acknowledgements

   None so far
